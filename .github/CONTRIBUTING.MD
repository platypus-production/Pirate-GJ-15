### Developer Notes

`[GAME_NAME]` is developed using Typescript and Node.js 20.X or >, so you shouldn't run into issues testing the repository on later versions.

#### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/platypus-production/Pirate-GJ-15
cd Pirate-GJ-15
pnpm i
```

That's all there is to it for setup project.

#### Keep In Mind

- **Follow the coding** conventions. Run `pnpm xo` to spot linting problems early.
- **Avoid making changes directly on** `main`, **use topic branches instead**. Use `git checkout {feature|bugfix|hotfix}/[feature_name]` (of course, replacing `feature-branch` with a name you feel more appropriate), edit and commit your changes there (start your commit with `FEATURE` for new feature, `FIX` if resolve problem, `WIP` if not finish your job ...). Run `git push` when you're done.
- `Refrain from editing the repository through GitHub`. Changes made with the GitHub editor are cumbersome and harder to evaluate, especially changes made to the source code. Changes made on a local working copy are more reliable and more appropriate pull requests.

> OK, nobody is perfect. Don't feel intimidated if you don't know how to do all that stuff. I won't turn down your proposal right away just because you have failed any of these prerequisites, too. When applicable, I can do the necessary amendments and apply your changes. Just be careful and do your best!
